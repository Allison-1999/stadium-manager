# Stadium Manager
Stadium Manager is a C/C++-based command-line comprehensive stadium management system that can manage venue information and users reserve venues. For the administrator, a simple UI and guidance are provided for the administrator to facilitate the administrator to better query and manage order information. In terms of venues, the administrator can easily find the venues of their own venues and create new venues. At the same time, it provides administrators with functions such as query, statistics, sorting, and management of user information, order information, and venue information. This system provides customers with guidance to help them complete their orders. At the same time, it provides users with statistical classification so that users can understand the information at a glance. In addition, a recommendation algorithm is also designed to provide users with personalized information, so that users can find suitable and needed venues more quickly, and make stadium reservations in a more efficient manner.
Stadium Manager is completed in the BUPT course design and is only used by teachers for grading.
